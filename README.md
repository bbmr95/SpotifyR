# SpotifyR
Armando bases de datos utilizando el API de Spotify


What does Spotify mean when it talks about popularity popularity level? What is the trend of daily followers of our favourites bands/artists?

These are the questions i have when i found the "spotifyr" package and exploring through their functions. And, as a Data Analyst, i couldn't do more than exploring and structuring
data bases with the most importants features (for me) extract from some of the most interesting functions in the API i found.

With the motivation of curiosity, then i think "if i have daily register of popularity and followers from any artists profile, is this data would be valued
for them, right?". And with the hipotesis of thinking that this is correct, i'm currently working on the daily automation of the DB.
